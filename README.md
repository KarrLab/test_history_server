Unit test history report server

## Installation
1. Create a database
2. Install package
  ```
  pip install -e git+https://github.com/KarrLab/test_history_server -t /path/to/web-server/test_history_server
  ```
3. Edit site and database configuration in `test_history_server/settings.py`
4. Setup database
  ```
  python test_history_server/manage.py syncdb
  ```
5. Edit server configuration in `passenger_wsgi.py`

## Usage

### Browsing test histories
To browse test histories, open the URL specified by `ROOT_URL` in `test_history_server/settings.py`.

### Uploading test reports
The following example illustrates how to add test reports to the database:
```
import requests

r = requests.post('<settings.ROOT_URL>/submit_report',
      data={
          'token': <test_server_token>,
          'repo_name': <repo_name>,
          'repo_owner': <repo_owner>,
          'repo_branch': <repo_branch>,
          'repo_revision': <repo_revision>,
          'build_num': <build_num>,
          'report_name': <extra textual label for individual reports within build, such as to indicate results from different versions of Python>,
      },
      files={
          'report': </path/to/junit-style-XML-test-report.xml>,
      })

r_json = r.json()

if not r_json['success']:
    raise BuildHelperError('Error uploading report to test history server: {}'.format(r_json['message']))
```
